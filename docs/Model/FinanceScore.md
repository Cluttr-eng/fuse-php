**expense_stability_score** | **float** | This assesses the consistency of a user&#39;s monthly spending. A lower score indicates variable monthly expenditure, while a higher score represents consistent spending habits. |
**activity_age_score** | **float** | This measures the regularity of a user&#39;s financial activity over a period of time. A lower score suggests limited activity, while a higher score is indicative of regular daily transactions over a long period of time. |
**income_score** | **float** | This evaluates the stability of a user&#39;s income. A lower score suggests inconsistent or low income, while a higher score represents high, consistent income. |
